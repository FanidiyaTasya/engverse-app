    passage: `
      The process of photosynthesis is fundamental for life on Earth. It allows plants to convert light energy into chemical energy, 
      which is then used to fuel the plant's activities and provide oxygen as a byproduct. This process mainly occurs in the leaves, 
      where chlorophyll pigments absorb sunlight. The light energy excites electrons, initiating a chain reaction that produces carbohydrates 
      from water and carbon dioxide.

      Photosynthesis plays a crucial role in the carbon cycle, as it helps remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and convert it into 
      organic compounds. Furthermore, the oxygen released during photosynthesis is essential for aerobic organisms, including humans. 
      Understanding this process has also led to advances in agricultural practices and renewable energy research.

      Environmental conditions such as light intensity, temperature, and water availability can affect photosynthesis rates. 
      Plants have adapted various mechanisms to optimize the process, such as opening stomata during the day and closing them at night 
      to reduce water loss.

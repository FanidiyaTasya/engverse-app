    "script": "M : Hi, Susan. How are you getting on with your English studies? \nW : It's hard. I have been in England for a year, but when people talk, I keep going blank and can't register what they say. \nM : Don't worry. You have to be patient and practice English more. \nW : It's very strange, you know, my son, Eric, is only four, but he seems to learn English much more quickly than I do. Why is it easy for young children to learn a language? \nM : I think part of the answer is that children are learning new things all the time. Their brains are still developing, so it makes their brains more flexible for learning. \nW : I agree with you. We, adults, need to learn new things as well, especially when we settle in a foreign country. But it takes us a long time to get used to a new life than young children. \nM : Yes. Another part of the answer is that older people are more fixed in their ways of living. It is not easy for adults to change from one language to another because we have been hearing and talking in one language for a long time. However, children are not used to that. \nW : Yeah. A child's mind is free in his ways. He is free to hear sounds as they are and make them as he hears them. He is free to put new words together and speaks a new language. \nM : I think that is why they learn things so fast. They are more focused and have less expectation of what they should be heard. \nW : That's true. I have had this kind of problem months ago. I was asking the way to the station to someone, and I couldn't recognize the difference between “light” and “right.” I thought I was supposed to go right when I should turn at the light. It took me two hours to get to the station. \nM : I'm sorry to hear that. You know, practice makes everything perfect. You can try to talk with others who use the language well. Also, it takes time to learn a language as an adult. Don't beat yourself up for past mistakes. \nW : Thank you. I will take that in mind.",

    "script": "The discovery of the planet Neptune was one of the highest points in the develop ment of gravitational theory. You might remember that most people before this time believed in the geocentric view of the Earth. That is the Earth was the center of the uni verse and the Sun, the Moon, and other planets revolve around it. And it was Copernicus who first purpose the heliocentric theory that the Earth and the others planet in the solar system revolve around the sun. Still, it took a couple of hundred years for scientists and researchers to change their view and admit that the heliocentric theory was and is indeed accurate. At that time, Copernicus could not explain the reason why and how the planets re volve around the Sun, thus making the geocentric theory had been accepted for over a thousand years. Now, this is where the hero of the story of the heliocentric theory, grav ity, comes into play. The motion of the planet has to be explained through some type of mechanism, and that turns out to be gravity. It's the gravitational pull that eventually helps astronomers understand how the planets revolve around the Sun. And that leads us to the discovery of Neptune. So, in the decade following its discovery, the orbit of Uranus had been calculated. But there was a problem. Uranus did not move in the orbit predicted by the theory of gravitational pull. By 1814, over 50 years after it was called a planet, it was clear that Ura nus did not move in orbit according to the one predicted by the gravitational theory. In 1843, John Couch Adams, a young English man, began a detailed mathematical analysis of the motion of the Uranus to see whether they might be produced by the pull of an unknown planet. He guessed that there must be a planet more distant from the sun than Uranus and then determined the mass and the orbit it had to have to count Ura nus' strange orbit. About a month later, an astronomer in Germany started to look for the planet. He quickly found and identified it. It was less than a degree from the posi tion predicted by Adams. The discovery of this faraway planet, Neptune, was a major triumph for gravitational theory. Because it's dramatically confirmed its laws with a great deal of accuracy.

It's kind of like trying to put together a puzzle where most of the pieces are missing. The most common sources for Greek history fall within two categories: literary works, which include fiction and nonfiction, and archaeological finds. Homer's epics are considered essential reading for most students. From a historian's perspective, however, they are quite a headache to interpret. You see, the stories of the Iliad and Odyssey were originally oral tales, told through word of mouth rather than writ ten on paper. The events they describe occurred well before they were finally written down by Homer in the 6th century BC. These works most likely do not reflect the society of any particular Greek city-state at any one period, but rather a mixture of places and times. Their value for historians, as a result, rests more on their impact on later Greek culture, rather than on providing information about the time that is written about. Herodotus mostly described the history of Athens, and from the way he writes it's clear that he is Athenian and very much concerned with making his culture appear dominant, so it's hard to rely completely on his book Histories, which describes the Per sian War. Besides Homer and Herodotus, we also have the famous philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. Now, even though all of these texts come from different fields, particularly literature, history, and philosophy, we must still be cautious. Besides believing in the superiority of their own culture, the authors of these sources were men and provide very little evidence of the lives and perspectives of women in the Greek world, except as seen through the eyes of men. Secondly, most of the authors were wealthy individuals; thus, their perspective does not reflect that of most citizens and slaves. Besides literary sources, there is also, thankfully, archaeological evidence that we can examine and, fill in the gaps, so to speak, from the literature. Archaeological sources provide us with key information about different aspects of everyday life in different city states. For example, in one famous Greek city, archaeologists found that each citizen was given an equal piece of land. Imagine, every single person in a city having an equal amount of space. This one simple find shows that the Greeks were interested in city planning and the inequality of citizens. So, my point is that by combining literary and archaeological sources, historians can complete much more of the puzzle than would have been possible with just the litera ture.

    "script": "Modern scholars are obsessed with analyzing primary sources of cultures from the ancient world, and that comes with good reason, especially when studying ancient Greeks history. It's kind of like trying to put together a puzzle where most of the pieces are missing. The most common sources for Greek history fall within two categories: literary works, which include fiction and nonfiction, and archaeological finds. Homer's epics are considered essential reading for most students. From a historian's perspective, however, they are quite a headache to interpret. You see, the stories of the Iliad and Odyssey were originally oral tales, told through word of mouth rather than writ ten on paper. The events they describe occurred well before they were finally written down by Homer in the 6th century BC. These works most likely do not reflect the society of any particular Greek city-state at any one period, but rather a mixture of places and times. Their value for historians, as a result, rests more on their impact on later Greek culture, rather than on providing information about the time that is written about. Herodotus mostly described the history of Athens, and from the way he writes it's clear that he is Athenian and very much concerned with making his culture appear dominant, so it's hard to rely completely on his book Histories, which describes the Per sian War. Besides Homer and Herodotus, we also have the famous philosophies of Plato and Aristotle. Now, even though all of these texts come from different fields, particularly literature, history, and philosophy, we must still be cautious. Besides believing in the superiority of their own culture, the authors of these sources were men and provide very little evidence of the lives and perspectives of women in the Greek world, except as seen through the eyes of men. Secondly, most of the authors were wealthy individuals; thus, their perspective does not reflect that of most citizens and slaves. Besides literary sources, there is also, thankfully, archaeological evidence that we can examine and, fill in the gaps, so to speak, from the literature. Archaeological sources provide us with key information about different aspects of everyday life in different city states. For example, in one famous Greek city, archaeologists found that each citizen was given an equal piece of land. Imagine, every single person in a city having an equal amount of space.

There are three possible theories about how the moon was created. The first one is the capture theory because it's the easiest one to reject. Its primary drawback is that no one knows of any way that early Earth could have captured such a large moon from elsewhere. One body approaching another cannot go into orbit around it without a serious loss of energy. Furthermore, if such a capture did take place, the captured object would go into a very strange orbit rather than the nearly circular or bit our moon goes through today. Finally, there are too many similarities in composition between Earth and the moon. It's much more likely that the Earth and the moon were somehow connected at one point in the past. The second is the fission theory suggests that the moon separated from the Earth, but modern calculations have shown that this type of splitting is nearly impossible. Fur thermore, it is difficult to understand how a moon made of materials from the Earth could have developed so many chemical differences from our own. The last, the sister theory, was the dominant idea accepted by most astronomers in the past. But, like the capture and fission theory, it had some problems, particularly when trying to explain how it could have such a lower density when compared to the Earth. Now, to resolve these apparent contradictions, scientists developed a fourth hypothesis for the origin of the moon, one that involves a giant impact early in Earth's history. This idea, known as the giant impact hypothesis, proposes that Earth was struck by an object approximately one-tenth of Earth's mass, which is about the size of Mars. This is very nearly the largest impact Earth could experience without being shattered. Such an impact would disrupt much of Earth and eject a vast amount of material into space, releasing almost enough energy to break the planet apart. Computer simulations indi cate that material totaling several percent of Earth's mass could be ejected in such an impact. Most of this material would be from the stony mantles of Earth and the impact ing body, not from their metal cores. This ejected rock would then cool and form a ring of material orbiting Earth. It was this ring that ultimately came together and formed the moon.

To understand that, you need to know about plate tectonics or a theory that explains how slow motions within the earth's interior move large pieces of land, resulting in a gradual “drifting” or spreading out of the continents. Plate tectonics is also a way for Earth to transport heat efficiently from the interior, where it has accumulated, out to space. It is a cooling system for the planet. Earth's crust is divided into about a dozen tectonic plates that fit together like piec es of a puzzle. In some places, such as the Atlantic Ocean, the plates are moving apart; in others, such as off the western coast of South America, they are being forced together. The power to move the plates is provided through a process by which heat escapes from the interior through the upward flow of warmer material and the slow sinking of cooler material. As the plates slowly move, they bump into each other and cause dramatic changes in Earth's crust over time. You know, when studying maps of Earth, many students notice that the coast of North and South America could fit pretty well against the coast of Europe and Africa. It seems as if these great land masses could have once been together and then were somehow torn apart. The scientist who made the case for continental drift in 1920 was the German meteorologist named Alfred Wegener. From an early age, Wegener dreamed of exploring. He carried out experiments us ing kites and balloons, becoming so accomplished that he and his brother set a world record in 1906 by flying for 52 hours in a balloon. Wegener first thought of continental drift in 1910 while examining a world map in an atlas. Wegener's evidence went far beyond the similarities in the shapes of the con tinents. He proposed that the similarities between fossils found only in South America and Africa indicated that these two continents were joined at one time. He also showed that similarities among living animal species on different continents could be best ex plained by assuming that the continents were once connected in a supercontinent he called Pangaea (from Greek elements pan meaning “all” and gaea meaning “land”). Wegener's suggestion was met with a hostile reaction from most scientists. Although he had collected an impressive list of arguments for his hypothesis, he was missing a mechanism. No one could explain how solid continents could drift over thousands of miles. Many found the idea of moving continents too revolutionary to take seriously. Developing an understanding of the mechanism –plate tectonics– would take decades of further research. Critics of science often point to the resistance to the continental drift hypothesis as an example of the flawed way that scientists regard new ideas. But there is a more positive light in which to view Wegener's story. Scientists in his day maintained a skeptical attitude because they needed more evidence and a clear mechanism that would fit what they understood about nature. Once the evidence was clear, Wegener's hypothesis quickly became the centerpiece of our view of a dynamic Earth.",

To understand that, you need to know about plate tectonics or a theory that explains how slow motions within the earth's interior move large pieces of land, resulting in a gradual “drifting” or spreading out of the continents. Plate tectonics is also a way for Earth to transport heat efficiently from the interior, where it has accumulated, out to space. It is a cooling system for the planet. Earth's crust is divided into about a dozen tectonic plates that fit together like piec es of a puzzle. In some places, such as the Atlantic Ocean, the plates are moving apart; in others, such as off the western coast of South America, they are being forced together. The power to move the plates is provided through a process by which heat escapes from the interior through the upward flow of warmer material and the slow sinking of cooler material. As the plates slowly move, they bump into each other and cause dramatic changes in Earth's crust over time. You know, when studying maps of Earth, many students notice that the coast of North and South America could fit pretty well against the coast of Europe and Africa. It seems as if these great land masses could have once been together and then were somehow torn apart. The scientist who made the case for continental drift in 1920 was the German meteorologist named Alfred Wegener. From an early age, Wegener dreamed of exploring. He carried out experiments us ing kites and balloons, becoming so accomplished that he and his brother set a world record in 1906 by flying for 52 hours in a balloon. Wegener first thought of continental drift in 1910 while examining a world map in an atlas. Wegener's evidence went far beyond the similarities in the shapes of the con tinents. He proposed that the similarities between fossils found only in South America and Africa indicated that these two continents were joined at one time. He also showed that similarities among living animal species on different continents could be best ex plained by assuming that the continents were once connected in a supercontinent he called Pangaea (from Greek elements pan meaning “all” and gaea meaning “land”). Wegener's suggestion was met with a hostile reaction from most scientists. Although he had collected an impressive list of arguments for his hypothesis, he was missing a mechanism. No one could explain how solid continents could drift over thousands of miles. Many found the idea of moving continents too revolutionary to take seriously. Developing an understanding of the mechanism –plate tectonics– would take decades of further research. Critics of science often point to the resistance to the continental drift hypothesis as an example of the flawed way that scientists regard new ideas. But there is a more positive light in which to view Wegener's story. Scientists in his day maintained a skeptical attitude because they needed more evidence and a clear mechanism that would fit what they understood about nature. Once the evidence was clear, Wegener's hypothesis quickly became the centerpiece of our view of a dynamic Earth.",
